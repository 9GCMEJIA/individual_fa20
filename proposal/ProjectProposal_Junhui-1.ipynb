    "Parks as public spaces are used to serve people for playing, relaxing, communicating and exercising. Since most San Diego parks have been built for a long time, their facilities, such as parking lots, irrigation system, park vehicles, lighting, drinking fountains and restrooms, may have declined and need maintenance and/or upgrade. The City of San Diego conducted surveys to San Diego residents and demonstrated that the residents express their willingness to upgrade parks and parks facilities (Parks Master Plan -- Needs + Priorities). Based on the consideration of facilities aging and resident feedback, it is reasonable to evaluate and check park facilities to determine which of them need maintenance and/or upgrade.   \n",
    "In addition to determine what parks and their facilities need maintenance and/or upgrade, the San Diego park system should "embrace opportunities to design and construct parks for greater efficiency and durability" (Parks Master Plan -- Existing Conditions Report). The mode of maintenance and/or upgrade should also focus on reducing future costs of maintenance and/or upgrade and conserving energy. For example, using smart water controller irrigation systems and LED lighting could reduce subsequent park expenditures and saving resources.   \n",
