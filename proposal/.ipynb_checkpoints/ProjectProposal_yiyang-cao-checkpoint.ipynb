    "I think the department should increase their following budget during COVID-19. Beacause of the disease, the actual passenger flow volumn decreased a lot, so the revenue earned from the passengers decreased as well. In order to sustain the system and programs, the department should increase the budget to cover more costs that was used to cover by the revanue."

    "To begin with, the analysis conducted only for San Diego city; there is a danger that the results of this analysis could be used to describe parks and recreations all over the country, which would be wrong. One ethics concern from the start of this analysis, is the bias that comes from choosing data only from the city of San Diego. One way to reduce this bias is using data from varied sources aditional to the department. In addition, it is crucial in the discussion section to explain how the results are only applicable to San Diego area. Finally, the budget and expenditure informtion are already public but they could be used to argue against the importance of these programs, which is not the goal of the analysis."
