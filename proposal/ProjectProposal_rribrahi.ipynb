    "There will not be too much trouble trouble gathering the data for this research considering that the data is on the web for public, however, it is important to be careful when disclosing information about who specifically is conducting the crime and where exaclty the crime is located. One potential detriment to this study is once we find more concrete evidence suggesting that parks may or may not help decrease crime, there may be some entities trying manipulate those areas funding for new recreational additions. This could be problematic for future inquiries. All in all, the data does not present itself to have biases besides the fact that the data is going to look specifically at urbanized areas of the U.S.. "
