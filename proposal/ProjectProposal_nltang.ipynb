    "Parks and public recreational areas are funded and maintained by the cities and counties they are located in. The distribution and use of these funds are decided by the city government and detailed in a publicly released fiscal year budget. In 2020, San Diego plans to spend 158 million dollars on parks and recreation [1]. There are multiple categories the money will be divided into: maintenance, projects, etc. /n",
    "The city of San Diego has previously conducted internal and third-party studies on their parks. In July 2020, a draft of a citywide park development impact fee Nexus Study was released. The study details the cost to residents of proposed improvements and compares them to the improvement in recreation that is generated by investment in a park[2].\n",

    "Since increases in funding can be used to increase the cleanliness of a park or improve the infrastructure of the park, parks that receive an increase in funding should see an increase in the number of visitors. Promotion of a park, either by city event or announcements of improvement, should incentivize more people to visit."

Variables can include the amount of money spent on maintenance, when the last project was completed at the park, how many city events were held in the park, and how many annual visitors the park received.

    "Ethical concerns for the use of analysis include the misuse of the information about the number of visitors and where the public’s money is spent. Another possible unintended consequence of this study is the exposure of less funded, or older parks. This data could highlight that some parks are underfunded and make them appear less desirable to prospective visitors. These results should not be used to describe the relationships between parks and visitors anywhere but San Diego."
