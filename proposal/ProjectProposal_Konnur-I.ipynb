    "With 57 recreation centers, 13 aquatic centers, and approximately 260 playgrounds in 8,700 acres of developed parks the San Diego Parks and Recreation department is spread thin when it comes to deciding where to put money for future expansions and upgrades [1]. In Balboa Park alone over 300 million dollars is required for much needed repairs and upkeep in the park but the money is instead being put towards parking projects in the park [2]. This kind of misallocation of funds could be avoided by looking at the relationship between traffic and budgets for improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to more efficiently allocate funds for parks around the city I believe it would be beneifical to know what traffic is like in areas when determining their budgets for improvement so we can allocate more money for road improvements or facility improvements accordingly. San Diego Parks and Recreations had a total budget of just over 116 million dollars in 2019, being able to efficiently allocate the budgeted money could help save the city thousands of dollars that would be spent on underutilized facilities or roads because they didn't analyze what areas would benefit from different improvements [3].\n",
