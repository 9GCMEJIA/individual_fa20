    "The city of San Diego publishes a financial outlook outline every five fiscal years to give you a glimpse into how much renevue they are forecasting, in addition to allocation of funds to specific departments. In the outline, it is stated that the City is planning to build a number of new facilities in an effort to add enrichment to people's lives. This will add some new parks to neighborhoods that have few or none. Additionally, some of these new areas will be joint use parks, which are parks designated for use by school-aged children during school days. For the fiscal period from 2020-2024, the City plans to allott around $400,000 towards the construction of Parks and Recreation facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this proposed budget is just a fraction of what it could potentially be. COVID-19 has reduced tourism in many cities, including San Diego, thus substantially reducing revenue. According to Joe Leventhal, the City plans to slash spending for Parks and Recreation by 5.9 million - mainly by cutting recreation center hours.\n",
