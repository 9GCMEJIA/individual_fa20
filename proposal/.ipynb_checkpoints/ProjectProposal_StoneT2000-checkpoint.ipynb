    "Parks have always been essential to welfare to cities such as San Diego. However, COVID-19 has severely impacted the parks, leading to a San Diego wide COVID-19 response that involved actions such as postponing events, closing down parks, cancelling events [1], among many other restricting actions. This comes along with notices that are further aimed at discouraging crowding at parks and reducing the density of people at parks at any given time [2]. News like the above and new signs put around parks has caused not only parks to work in limited capacities, but significantly discourage park attendance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Past research has been done on the impact of COVID-19 on the behavior of park users by analyzing pre and post covid numbers on a number of metrics. The research indicates a decrease in various metrics such as how far were parkgoers willing to travel to a park, how often they go to parks, average group size etc. [3]. The research further goes to analyze the data in relation to rural, urban cluster, and urban area residents, showing rural residents being less affected by covid-19 compared to urban residents.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has also been recommendations towards encouraging more park use through transforming roadways to pedestrian paths to encourage more movement whilst maintaining social distancing, as well as recommending design decisions to public spaces that encourage social distancing and give citizens the confidence to continue to access and use parks without worrying about COVID-19 [3]. There is also research towards place attachment, personal space, and proxemics, and how biophilic design can help build healing environments that can positive impact parks [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, past research shows that COVID-19 has impacted certain citizens more than others in relation to park usage, and there are various existing recommendations aimed at decreasing the negative impact COVID-19 has had on park use.\n",

   "source": [
    "I hypothesize that the more COVID-19 infections and higher population density an area of San Diego has, the less park foot-traffic there will be in that area. Areas that are densely populated will discourage people from going to parks due to less confidednce in the safety of their health at parks. For the same reason, the more COVID-19 infections an area has, the less confidence citizens will have about their personal safety and are less likely to risk going outside and to a park."

We can effectively add all the columns from the population and covid-19 dataset to the parks dataset and the values we store there are whichever observation in the population and covid-19 dataset is closest in location to the park by using the longitude and latitude.\n"
