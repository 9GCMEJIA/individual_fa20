    "   There is no doubt that parks and recreational places can add more job opportunities helping communities become more productive. In 2016, the city of San Diego made a Master plan that would help promote safer and healthier communities. In this plan they talk about how the aiding of parks and recreational places could help from promoting more diversity in communities to producing a more productive tourist industry. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   However according to a map of San Diego crime rates, parks and recreational places don't seem to affect crime rates across San Diego. For example, some areas where well-known parks are like Mission Bay Park and Balboa Park have some of the higher crime rates in San Diego. Others areas located in LaJolla and sunset have some of the lowest crime rates in San Diego. I appears to seem that the county's determinations that more parks/recreational areas can help lower crime rates don't seem to be true   \n",

Each line on the data set would represent communitites or small businesses that are situated around a park and/or recreational area. To collect this data, I would have to go search online for these neighborhoods and small businesses that are affected by the parks and recreation; search how income/crime rates are affect over a period of time. To store these data, I would utilize a table in excel containing neighborhood names and crime rates each month/year and small businesses and income each month/year."
