    "Animatronics at SeaWorld would not reduce engagement from visitors significantly. Not only would animatronics be less expensive and easier to care for, but visitors could also more safely and closely engage with the exhibits at theme parks. In the long term, this could even generate more interest in biology and robotics."

    "Data to set the stage would be related to SeaWorld's decrease in revenue after the release if *Blackfish* (2013). The documentary not only raised awareness for the cruelty in keeping orcas in captivity but also prompted the need for alternatives to entertain people. It may also be worth noting that some aquarium inhabitants (fish, sharks, and cephalopods, for instance) do not necessarily have to be replaced because they tend to live longer in captivity (source needed), as opposed to marine mammals such as dolphins which need much more social engagement and space to roam free. Captive orcas tend to be more aggressive than wild ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data to support my hypothesis would be data that indicates visitor engagement at theme parks that use animatronics as opposed to real animals in their exhibits. Engagement would be measured through revenue generated by the parks. These data should be available online."
