    "The intersection of crime and community can often be puzzling, bringing into question which influences the other more and positively or negatively? In this project, with public parks as a representation of a community, I aimed to understand how crime in public parks in the San Diego area affects its attractiveness to locals and tourists or vice versa. To do so, I analyzed the relationship between Yelp ratings of San Diego public parks and the number of police dispatches in the area around said parks. From this analysis, the data suggests that"

    "San Diego Parks and Recreation accounts for overseeing nearly all public space including 40,000 acres of developed and undeveloped open space, 340 parks, 25 miles of shoreline, 57 recreation centers, 13 pools, 7 skate parks, 3 golf courses. Their overall mission is: \"To provide healthy, sustainable, and enriching environments for all.\" Their vision on the other hand is \"To connect all to the cityâ€™s diverse world class park system.\" In past studies, scholars have explored the relationship between park facilities, observed park use, and physical activity levels, but did not stray too far away to analyze the intersecting trends and consequences between the parks and the neighboring community. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp is a popular ratings and review platform for many public and private facilities and provides a good insight into the general community opinion of the local San Diego parks. This includes ratings on 5 star scale and written reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are not many studies looking into the comparison of crime in public parks and data from the community (Yelp, in this case), there have been speculations and observations made claiming that parks act as crime inhibitors or generators. This notion relies on the idea that \"nearby land uses and socio-demographic characteristics are a key driver of crime being located within the park or nearby the park.\" San Diego, specifically, has recently began instilling park curfews in response to many crime concerns around the Pacific Beach/Mission Bay area. Spiked crime in parks may dwell in the very nature that parks are public, available to all, and often unsupervised. On the otherhand, parks are also said to be very \"critical\" for low income or underprivileged communities, providing a free space to congregate or spend leisure time. Thus, in the eyes of the community parks can be a blessing or curse.\n",

    "I hypothesize that a higher frequency of local crime near San Diego public parks correlate to a lower Yelp rating, while lower frequencies will correlate to a higher rating. I predict this case because Yelp reviews are often both locals and tourists--everyday citizens--rather than official inspectors and thus they overlap with the population of locals who also make the police calls. This may point to a more negative outlook by the community who has to deal with the rampant crime."
