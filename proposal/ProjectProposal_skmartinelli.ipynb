I'm curious to see how films portraying the crimes could have an impact on the amount of these crimes being commited or attempted. Additionally after looking into the data I'm interested to see if there's other correlations to be found, as the FBI releases annual detailed reports about bank crimes. * \n",

There could be other variables involved such as the sex or ethnicity, success rate or even amount stolen, but I think the main one I should focus on is the amount of crimes committed or attempted. The FBI already releases a robust dataset of annual bank crimes so I plan to use that. It's linked above. I would plan to organize the data in a line graph because that would be the best way to show its changes over time.*"

The amount shown isn't representative of many different factors which may contribute to different ethinicities committing more or less bank robberies so I think it would be best to avoid it. Same thing with sex, but I feel like that may be easier to work with."
