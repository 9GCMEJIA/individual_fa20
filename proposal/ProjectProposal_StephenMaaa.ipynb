    "Currently, there are 400+ parks in San Diego, with 40,000+ acres of park assets [1]. <br>\n",
    "As the parking lots are in shortage recently, especially for parks nearby the beach, City of San Diego had passed certain regulations on parking to prevent parking shortage and possible traffic congestion [2]. <br>\n",
    "The common modes of transport to parks are walking, riding, driving and taking bus or other public transportations. Walking and hiking are usually favored by people lived nearby. Therefore, for people who live far away from a certain park, they either drive, call a car or take public transportations. As the limits of parking lots, driving a private car sometimes falls into the problem of parking. And calling a uber can be relatively expensive. Public transportations seem to be a popular, economical and eco-friendly mode of transport. San Diego offers transports services such as buses, waterfront shuttles, trains, pedicabs and trolley [3]. Most of them are under the Metropolitan Transit System. We can get all stations nearby parks from the schedules and routes [4]. <br>\n",
    "The ratings and reviews of parks in San Diego can be found on Google Map, Yelp, and TripAdvisor. We can use that quantify and judge if a park is good or not. Also, we can get the pros and cons of a park from the reviews. <br>\n",

   "source": [
    "I hypothesize that there a positive relationship between the availibity of public transportations near the park and ratings of parks. Because the availibity of public transportations, or we can say the numbers of stations nearby, decides whether people who live far away can go to the park easily, besides driving. In this case, if there is no adjacent station, they probably won't go to this park where they previously planned to. Also, if there're many stations nearby, they can come to the park frequently and leave a good rating, as convenient transport can be a factor in rating. <hr>\n",
    "Also, I hypothesize that there is a positive relationship between the demands in parking lots and ratings of parks. Because the shortage of parking lots can come from too many demands from people who drive to the park. From the situation that many people drive to the park, we can conclude that the park is popular and has a good rating."
