    "COVID-19 will have long lasting effects on San Diego Parks and Recreation for the next five years as a lot of services and amenities aren't being used, and funds from the city and state are likely to be lowered. Some of the amenities might have to be cut in order to lower the costs to maintain the parks and rec system. In the first reference, we can already see that the revenue generated from parks this year is lower than last year's.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that in the second reference link, the budget to operate and maintain parks and rec for the year 2020-2021 will be about $20,400,000 less than the previous year. Changes to operating hours as well cuts to certain art fundings were already proposed. It's likely that we would have to make more similar changes and perhaps even discontinue funding to facilities that being used by very few people. \n",

I would also want data on the amount of revenue that each park brings in(for the parks that do generate revenue) over the last 2 years. San Diego Parks and Recreation should have a record of all these data. These data would be organized into line graphs to show the changes over time(and during the period of the pandemic), and bar graphs to show the difference of each park and amenities. "

After the analysis, it's very possible that certain facilities would be proposed to be closed or that operating hours would be shortened. That would affect the people that uses those facilities, or perhaps even depend on them. What we can do handle these issues is to provide them with information about places where they can get similar services or help if they do depend on them. "
