    "Given the amount of traffic that accumulates on busy days, is it necessary for additional parking spaces to be added to Balboa Park? If so, where should these be added to minimize traffic congestion within the park? If not, what strategies can be implemented to maximize efficiency of existing lots?\n"

    "Based on existing studies highlighting the surplus of lesser known parking spaces already existing within the park, along with the influence of COVID-19 on current travel habits, I do not think that the creation of additional parking spaces is currently necessary. On the other hand, in order to increase efficiency of parking throughout the park, I do think that strategies such as time limits need to be enforced in close-in parking lots in order to encourage visitors to park in more remote lots as well. Furthermore, I also support initiatives such as carpooling and public transportation directed toward employees and volunteers in order to open more spots for visitors.\n"

    "For this project, I think that data regarding traffic and parking within Balboa Park in recent years is necessary to answer the question proposed. Specifically, datasets recording how many employees, volunteers, and visitors enter the park on a daily basis, where and how long they park, how many parking spaces there are in each area of the park and what percentage of them are occupied on average daily are needed. Information about employee needs regarding parking and how to get to where they need to work is also needed if considering public transportation strategies for them. It also may be useful to obtain data regarding how efficiently parking time limits and parking meters work in other parks or public areas throughout San Diego in order to gauge whether they will be suitable strategies to implement in Balboa Park. As Balboa Park attracts many visitors, I think it is possible and important to get at least a thousand observations from visitors, in order to achieve a larger sample size and attain a better understanding of parking habits within the park.\n"

    "The two references that I plan to use were taken from the San Diego Parks and Recreation website, and were openly made available under a list of documents for consultants to reference. Information regarding employees and visitors are all anonymous, and there is otherwise no way to identify individuals from which the statistics were taken. As for possible biases, some information tables in the Parking Management Action Plan for Balboa Park was discovered solely by the Tilghman Group, so I believe it would be a good idea to find additional data not by the group in order to ensure that their information is unbiased and not attempting to paint a particular picture. Besides that, there is a vast amount of relevant data within both sources, and they include information about employees, volunteers, and visitors so I believe that no particular group of people is being excluded. However, the results of this project would doubtlessly affect all three groups that attend the park, so it is important to consider all of their interests and find a solution that does not for example, facilitate parking for visitors while putting employees and volunteers at a disadvantage. The best solution would involve a compromise between all three groups. It is also crucial to consider how changes in the parking system would affect pedestrians and people who visit the park without driving, as well as who would fund these changes and whether or not there is any bias there. Finally, I believe that the results of this project could be monitored in the future by collecting data about parking and motoristsâ€™ habits and determining whether or not the situation has improved.\n"
