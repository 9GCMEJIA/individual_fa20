    "Based on existing studies highlighting the surplus of lesser known parking spaces already existing within the park, along with the influence of COVID-19 on current travel habits, I do not think that the creation of additional parking spaces is currently necessary. On the other hand, in order to increase efficiency of parking throughout the park, I do think that strategies such as time limits need to be enforced in close-in parking lots in order to encourage visitors to park in more remote lots as well. Furthermore, I also support initiatives such as carpooling and public transportation directed toward employees and volunteers in order to open more spots for visitors.
