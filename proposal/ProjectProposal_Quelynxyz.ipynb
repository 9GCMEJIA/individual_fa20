    "Where I'm from in Los Angeles County, wealthier cities had nicer parks and park facilities. Considering that San Diego City has a population of 1.4 million people, approximately 100 different communities and neighborhoods, and 340 parks. There have been works displaying the disparity of park and recreational quality in correlation to the socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods, for example: In the Seattle region of Washington, lower income neighborhoods had better park quality(condition, cleanliness) on average. \n",
