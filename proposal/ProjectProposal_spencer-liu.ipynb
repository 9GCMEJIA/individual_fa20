However, generalized statistics that are anonymized may be released. The data available can, however, be theoretically deanonymized and be used to attack people who are already marginalized. Furthermore, if the information discovered is relevant to preventing drug relapses, it can be used to further unfair stereotyping of homeless people as drug addicts/alcoholics."
