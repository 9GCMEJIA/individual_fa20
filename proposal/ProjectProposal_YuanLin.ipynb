    "In order to slow down the spread of transmission of COVID-19 cases, the San Diego Parks & Recreation. Now the county is facing policy decisions about safe reopening in which the county needes to ensure the spread of COVID-19 is slowed down with the maximum amount of reopening allowed. It is important to determine if those facilities should be reopened, in what percent of full capacity should those facilities maintained, and if temporary closing is necessary. We need to find if reopening will significantly increase the spread of COVID-19, or the transmission rate won't be affected at all. \n",

I would have enough observations to cover the bulk of the county. The variables should be weather the parks and recreational facilities are reopened in the area, how many of those are opened, the population of that area, the covid cases trend of that area, etc. "
