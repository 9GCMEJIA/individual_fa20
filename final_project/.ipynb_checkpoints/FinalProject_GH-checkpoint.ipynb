    "The intersection of crime and community can often be puzzling, bringing into question which influences the other more and positively or negatively? In this project, with public parks as a representation of a community, I aimed to understand how crime in public parks in the San Diego area affect its attractiveness to locals and tourists or vice versa. To do so, I analyzed the relationship between Yelp ratings of San Diego public parks and the number of police dispatches in the area around said parks. From this analysis, the data suggests that"

    "San Diego Parks and Recreation accounts foroverseeing nearly all public space including 40,000 acres of developed and undeveloped open space, 340 parks, 25 miles of shoreline, 57 recreation centers, 13 pools, 7 skate parks, 3 golf courses. Their overall mission is: \"To provide healthy, sustainable, and enriching environments for all.\" Their vision on the other hand is \"To connect all to the cityâ€™s diverse world class park system.\" In past studies, scholars have explored the relationship between park facilities, observed park use, and physical activity levels. They saw differences and trends with sedentary versus active visitors, female versus male, plus senior visitors and usage, recognizing that public parks in San Diego and their physical activity facilities are critical resources for low income households and minority communities--especially Latino communities. This \"data could be used to leverage funding for personnel, programming, and enhancing and maintaining facilities.\" \n",
