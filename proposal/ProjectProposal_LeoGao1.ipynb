    "Parks are an essential resource for the public physical activity. As the main part of the parks, the facilities affect the user demographics and physical activity level. Stephanie T. Child and her teammates did research that analyzed the relationship among the three factors. Similarly, Andrew T. Kaczynski and his coworkers analyze the association of parks' size, distance, and features with physical activities in the neighborhood. \n",

    "In San Diego, there are 400+ parks and 57 recreation centers. The City of San Diego has a mission-- \"To provide healthy, sustainable, and enriching environments for all\" and a vision -- \"To connect all to the City’s diverse world class park system.\" The parks in San Diego can help us to better understand the relationship among the park facilities, user demographics, and physical activity level. Then, with the result, we are able to improve the park system in San Diego\n",

    "My hypothesis is that different park facilities have different impacts on user demographics and physical activity level. Certain kinds of facilities, say, basketball courts, have a larger effect, and other facilities may have smaller impact. By analyzing their scale of impact, we may determine which facility is most “valuable” to build or improve. Also, one kind of facility may fit a certain age group, which means we can change our plan with the age distribution of the local population. "

The ideal dataset should contain park location(string or postal code), park name or id, visit time, visitors’ ages and other features. If the dataset is formed by every visit (each visit is a row), I’ll group them by time, count the amount of different age groups and other features. If the dataset is formed by the summary of every period (the visitors per day/week), I’ll continue to do the next step of data cleaning.\n",
