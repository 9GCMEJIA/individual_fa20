    "San Diego, with its great weather, miles of sandy beaches, and major attractions, is known worldwide as one of the best tourist destinations and a great place for residents to relax year round. It has 57 Recreation Centers, 13 Pools, 7 Skate Parks, and more than 340 parks and 25 miles of shoreline from Sunset Cliffs to La Jolla [1]. Many evidence propose that there might be a positive relationship between the accessibility to parks or recreation centers and the lifespans of people living around them. For example, natural plants, trees, or other greenry can help absorb harmful air pollution and disturbing noise [2]. In addition to physical health, having outdoor spaces can help people socialize, improving people's mental health[2]. What's more, research also shows that there is a lifespan difference in San Diego between the rich, who live near parks and recreation centers, and the poor. For instance, it found that the average life expectancy in Point Loma is three years longer than in City Heights[3]. And giving kids a safe place to skateboard helps them get some exercise while staying off sidewalks or away from the front of businesses. And helping the community build its own park helps residents gain the confidence to address long-standing environmental challenges[3].\n",

    "My study then will collect and analyze data to examine whether people who live near well-designed open spaces in San Diego tend to have better living standard and lifespans, focusing on the relationship between mortality rates and average time spent in outdoor activities.  \n",

    "The ideal dataset should include the information of each sampled San Diego's citizen's leisure time spent in parks per week, the number of well-developed parks near household of each sampled individual's, current ages of each sampled individual, mortality rates, happiness, and life satisfaction. Those data can be collected from Gerenal Social Survey, a personal interview survey providing politicians, policymakers, and scholars with a clear and unbiased perspective on what Americans think and feel. And they will be stored in the csv format. To analyze, data will be ploted in order to figure out whether a positive relation exists between citizens' living standards and tthe frequency of activites in parks."
